### STEP 1 Install git
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, 
so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. 
Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
    
    sudo apt-get install git

### STEP 2 install python-dev

### STEP 3 Install setuptools and pip (Python's Package Manager).
Setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python distutils that allow developers 
to more easily build and distribute Python packages, especially ones that have 
dependencies on other packages. Packages built and distributed using setuptools 
look to the user like ordinary Python packages based on the distutils.

additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library.

    sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-pip

### STEP 4 Install virtualenv
virtualenv is a tool for creating isolated Python environments containing their own copy of
python , pip , and their own place to keep libraries installed from PyPI.
It's designed to allow you to work on multiple projects with different dependencies 
at the same time on the same machine.
    
    sudo apt-get install virtualenv
    
  CHECK PYTHON VERSION 
  
    python3 -V
  
  IF VERSION IS 3.8.X RUN
  
    sudo apt install python3.8-venv

  IF VERSION IS 3.10.X RUN
  
     sudo apt install python3.10-venv

      bench setup procfile
      
      
### To start develop server:
